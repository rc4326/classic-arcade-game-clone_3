#Frogger Clone

**Introduction:**
This game is a reproduction of the gameplay style of the classic 1980's video game Frogger.
The object of the game is to get the Cat Girl safetly across the path to the water without getting run over
by a bug.

**To start the game:**
Double click on the index.html file or right click on the index.html file and select open from the drop-down menu.

**How to Play:**
Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys on the keyboard to move the Cat Girl across the path to the water.
Avoid moving into a square with a bug in it and don't get run over by an advancing bug. Once you reach the water
You will get a dropdown success message. If you get run over by a bug you will get a death message. Once you have
read the message you can click OK to reset the round or advance to the next level.

**Points:**
Each successful trip to the water earns you 5 points, advances the level by 1, and increases the number of bugs you have to avoid.
After the second level random gems appear that are worth random points between 100 to 1000 points. Star's are worth 5000 points.

You can get run over by a bug 5 times before the game resets the level and your score.

See how high you can get your score and how many levels you can beat.

*Good luck and have fun!*
